PhD student at ULPGC in Computational Engineering. Having worked in research thanks to a European scholarship, my PhD is currently funded by a scholarship from the Government of the Canary Islands. In addition to continuing my research, I am starting my teaching career. My studies are focused on machine learning, computer vision, and biometrics. I am interested in multidisciplinary applications that bring current technologies to other fields.
